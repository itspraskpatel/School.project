You have to install few modules using command prompt.
Like:
mysql.connector

To install this open cmd and run following code:

python -m pip install mysql-connector-python
Or
pip install mysql-connector-python
Or
pip(python version) install mysql-connector-python
Or 
Google it yourself

If you get error try to update your pip version

You must be connected to internet for this


Also you must have wamp server installed
with default settings..
If you ever tweaked the settings reset it or else it will not work
